# 2D Racing game

# Main Features:

Static camera (we could improve that later on) with a view on top of the level.
At first we would have only 1 car, we can control it with the keyboard (see if we can include controllers for the keybindings as well).
UI would pop from ESC key, you would have various levels to choose.
On a second point we could implement a 2nd car that a 2nd player could control (for example, player 1 would control the 1st car with WASD and the 2nd player could control the 2nd car with UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys).


# Win conditions:

Be the first to complete the track <insert_amount_of_times_here> times.


# Lose conditions:

If you're not the first to complete the track <insert_amount_of_times_here> times, you lose.
If both players haven't finished the track after <insert_time_here> minutes, it's a draw.






# Requirements

# Assets:

2 cars - PNG (a texture that we will put on top of a cube or other simple polygon)
